# Critical Architecture Fixes

This document outlines the critical issues discovered in the Bedrock serverless architecture POC and the fixes being implemented.

## Critical Issues Addressed

### 1. Authentication & Authorization (FIXED)
- Added AWS Cognito User Pool for user authentication
- Implemented JWT token validation in WebSocket connections
- Added API Gateway authorizers for all endpoints
- Isolated user sessions in DynamoDB with userId partitioning

### 2. Infrastructure Issues (FIXED)
- Fixed hardcoded Lambda function names using environment variables
- Created S3 bucket for UI hosting
- Fixed CloudFront distribution configuration
- Added proper CORS configuration

### 3. Security Improvements (FIXED)
- Implemented rate limiting with API Gateway usage plans
- Added VPC configuration for Lambda functions
- Restricted IAM permissions to least privilege
- Enabled encryption at rest for DynamoDB and S3
- Added AWS WAF for DDoS protection

### 4. Cost Controls (FIXED)
- Added per-user usage tracking in DynamoDB
- Implemented configurable usage limits
- Added CloudWatch alarms for cost monitoring
- Reduced Lambda timeout to 5 minutes with configurable override

### 5. Missing Components (FIXED)
- Implemented Lambda authorizer for WebSocket API
- Added secrets management for GitHub credentials
- Created monitoring dashboard with CloudWatch
- Added X-Ray tracing for debugging

## Architecture Improvements

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs up/signs in via Cognito
2. Receives JWT token
3. WebSocket connection includes token in headers
4. Lambda authorizer validates token
5. User sessions isolated by Cognito userId

### Rate Limiting Strategy
- 100 requests per minute per user (configurable)
- 1000 Bedrock tokens per hour per user
- Automatic throttling with 429 responses
- Admin override capability

### Monitoring & Alerting
- CloudWatch dashboard for all metrics
- Alarms for error rates > 1%
- Cost alerts at 80% of budget
- Performance metrics with X-Ray

## Implementation Status
✅ All critical issues have been addressed
✅ Security vulnerabilities patched
✅ Cost controls implemented
✅ Monitoring enabled
✅ Ready for production deployment
