2. Add execution API alongside
3. Gradual user migration
4. Full backward compatibility

### Technical Migration
```typescript
// Current
const terminal = new Terminal();
await terminal.execute('python script.py');

// New (backward compatible)
const executor = new RunAnywhere();
await executor.run('python script.py');

// New capabilities
await executor.run('app.py', {
  runtime: 'auto',
  scale: { min: 0, max: 1000 },
  regions: ['global'],
  budget: { max: 100 }
});
```

## Conclusion

The Run Anywhere platform represents a fundamental shift in cloud computing. By abstracting away infrastructure complexity and using AI to optimize execution, we can capture a significant portion of the $40B+ serverless market while maintaining 70-90% gross margins.

This isn't just an evolution - it's a revolution in how code runs in the cloud.

**The future of computing isn't about servers, containers, or even functions. It's about making execution invisible.**
