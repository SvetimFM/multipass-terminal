# Cubicle 2 - AI Workspace

## Important Rules for AI

1. **You are in an isolated cubicle workspace** - Changes here won't affect the main project
2. **All project files are in the current directory** - No need to navigate elsewhere
3. **Use git to track your changes** - The cubicle has its own git history
4. **Sync with parent** updates this cubicle with latest changes from main project
5. **Your changes are preserved** until explicitly synced or reset

## Project Details
- **Project:** Terminal Self Edit
- **Path:** /mnt/j/DevWorkspace/Active Projects/vibecodes/ship_anywhere_serverside/ai-office/cubicle-2
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/SvetimFM/multipass-ai-terminal
- **Cloned from:** Repository was cloned directly into this cubicle

## Guidelines
- You are already in the project root - no need to change directories
- Make all changes directly in this directory
- Test thoroughly before suggesting merges to main project
- Use git commits to document your work
- This workspace is specifically for AI experimentation
- When ready, changes can be reviewed and potentially merged back
